According to Statistical Overview of the Canadian Field Vegetable Industry, last year Canada imported 266,270 (metric tons) of lettuce. This cost around 715,166 (CAN$ ‘000). This is the most imported fresh vegetable in our country. Canada only exports 36,691 (metric tons) of lettuce. 

So, why is Canada producing so little Lettuce? We have massive greenhouse farms in Ontario contributing to ⅖ of the production. Through some extensive research, a lot of the work done in those farms is through manual labor which can be slow and expensive.

Therefore, I will be designing a robot that uses computer vision and Mechacatronics aspects to plant lettuce at a faster rate and with cheaper technology allowing these companies to grow at a faster rate when using our technology.
